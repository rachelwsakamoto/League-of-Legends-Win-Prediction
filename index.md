<h1> League of Legends Prediction </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> League of Legends is a very popular game amongst the younger generation. The top percentile of playes can even make a living off of being good at the game. Naturally, if there is a pattern that can be observed that brings in more wins, we would want to find that out. Is there any pattern between those that choose Ashe versus Caitlyn as their Champion? </p>
<p> There are 5 rows in this dataset. We will be exploring the columns 'champion' (tells us the name of the fighter that the user plays as), 'results' (tells us if the game is won or last 1 being a win and 0 being a loss), 'kills', (tells us how many kills the player received per game) </p>
